### PROJECT TITLE: Diabetes Classification and Risk Factor Analysis

This project aims to classify patients as Diabetic, Non-Diabetic, or Prediabetic using machine learning models. Additionally, it identifies key risk factors contributing to diabetes. The dataset used for this study contains various health-related attributes, and the analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

### Dataset

The dataset is stored in "Dataset of Diabetes.csv" and contains information about patients, including:

Demographic detai**ls (**e.g., Gender)

Medical history and health parameters

Diabetes classification (Target variable: CLASS)

📂 Dataset Information

Name: Diabetes Dataset

Source: [https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wj9rwkp9c2/1  Rashid, Ahlam (2020), “Diabetes Dataset”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/wj9rwkp9c2.1]

Number of Records: 1000

Number of Features: 14

### Machine Learning Models Used

Two classification models were trained and evaluated:

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting Classifier

### Data Preprocessing Steps

Handling Missing Values: Checked for missing data and handled appropriately.

Feature Engineering: Converted categorical variables into numeric representations.

Data Normalization: Scaled the features using StandardScaler for better model performance.

Train-Test Split: Data was split into 80% training and 20% testing.

### Model Performance

Each model was evaluated using:

Accuracy Score

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

Confusion Matrix

### Best Performing Model:

Based on the accuracy scores, the better-performing model is Random Forest Classifier.

### Results and Insights

Key Findings:

The model successfully classifies patients with high accuracy.

Class imbalance was observed, with class 2 (Diabetic) being the most frequent category.

Feature importance analysis can help in understanding the significant predictors of diabetes.
